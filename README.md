## Current Work

  I'm a developer at Hasura, where I routinely speak, write, and provide materials around all the cool stuff related to the Hasura GraphQL product and tooling. But more than that, I delve into development patterns, practices, hacks, tips, tricks, and a lot more. Tune into some of the aforementioned channels and check out the plethora of material I have, plus a bit of heavy metal, biking, and life hacks as lagniappe!

## Repos of Note
