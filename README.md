## Current Work

Updates coming soon!

## Current WIP & Notable Repos

* [Current Work in Progress(WIP)](https://github.com/users/Adron/projects/2) - This is the global project for my respective projects that I'm currently working on in some way.
* [Example Go CLI w/ Cobra Repo](https://github.com/Adron/cobra-cli-samples) - A repo that provide a very basic, rudimentary use and implementation of a few of the features that are available with the Cobra CLI library for Go.

## Refactoring

* [tenancy-bydata](https://github.com/Adron/tenancy-bydata) is a project I'm working on to use as a base for deployment of solutions on Hasura that require multitenancy, i.e. you want to roll out an inexpensive **SAaaS** (**S**omething **A**nother **a**s **a** **S**ervice).
