## Current Work

  I'm a developer at Hasura, where I routinely speak, write, and provide materials around all the cool stuff related to the Hasura GraphQL product and tooling. But more than that, I delve into development patterns, practices, hacks, tips, tricks, and a lot more. Tune into some of the aforementioned channels and check out the plethora of material I have plus a bit of heavy metal, biking, and life hacks as lagniappe!

## Current WIP & Notable Repos

* [Current Work in Progress(WIP)](https://github.com/users/Adron/projects/2) - This is the global project for my respective projects that I'm currently working on in some way.
* [Example Go CLI w/ Cobra Repo](https://github.com/Adron/cobra-cli-samples) - A repo that provide a very basic, rudimentary use and implementation of a few of the features that are available with the Cobra CLI library for Go.
* [tenancy-bydata](https://github.com/Adron/tenancy-bydata) is a project I'm working on to use as a base for deployment of solutions on Hasura that require multitenancy, i.e. you want to roll out an inexpensive **SAaaS** (**S**omething **A**nother **a**s **a** **S**ervice).
* [arbitures](https://github.com/adron/arbitures) a project with a strange logo and the intent to take odd functionality that is needed for the multitenancy projects I'm building (like the [tenancy-bydata](https://github.com/Adron/tenancy-bydata) project) and put those into features in a CLI. Using the Cobra library and related libraries the features are open sourced here in [arbitures](https://github.com/adron/arbitures).
